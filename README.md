My first ERC-20 token deployed on Filecoin’s FEVM Calibration Testnet.
# My First Filecoin Token (Testnet)

# 📌 Description
This is my first ERC-20 token deployed on the Filecoin Calibration Testnet using the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM).

I built this project to learn how smart contracts work on Filecoin and how to deploy tokens using Remix, MetaMask, and the FEVM network.
